            "premise": " Of course, unless you've done lots of drugs, you probably don't know how educational and life-changing they are. So for anyone unsure about the positive effect of proper drug use, let me explain why the government shouldn't be in the business of interfering with personal decisions about using drugs. Individuals should have all the freedom they want to pursue their own views of the good life\u2014up to the point where an unwilling person could be harmed. This idea is captured by John Stuart Mill's \"harm principle,\" which holds that \u201cthe only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\u201d Freedom thus ends only where the next person\u2019s nose begins. There's two justifications for this limiting principle. First, it gives our government political legitimacy. In a \"state of nature,\" no political authority exists; individuals are free to do whatever they want. The only reason people give up some of that freedom is to be protected from being harmed by others. This establishes a limit on legitimate government interference. Second, the harm principle maximizes utility because it lets individuals weigh the costs and benefits of incommensurate goods subjectively (e.g. weighing pleasure from drugs vs health risks). Concepts like pleasure are inherently subjective, so the best way to maximize them is by letting individuals weigh them subjectively, as long as those actions don't harm anyone else. Under the harm principle, the government's job isn't to ensure people make smart decisions. Nobody should be punished for hurting their own mind or body. That's why suicide is legal. And if suicide is legal, so too should drugs be legal. And it doesn't matter if a particular drug is self-destructive\u2014its use has no effect on anyone but the person using the drug. This puts drugs firmly outside the scope of legitimate government control. The United States should therefore legalize all drugs no matter how self-destructive it is. And the usual responses\u2014that consuming drugs isn't entirely self-regarding, and that the costs of legalization outweigh the benefits\u2014aren't compelling.",

The issue, then, is the circumstances surrounding consumption, not drug use itself.",

            "claim": "",
            "premise": " Second, the costs of drug prohibition outweigh the benefits twice over. In particular, prohibition causes the following harms: (1) Consuming drugs becomes extremely dangerous because of the potential to suffer poisoning from an adulterated batch, or to overdose because a batch is more pure than believed. (2) Street drugs are easily available to children. (3) Dealers charge monopoly prices, so addicts can't spare money for anything else. This drives addicts to homelessness, prostitution, or property crime, simply to afford the drugs. (4) In drug-dominated neighborhoods, people experience a significant deterioration in the quality of life, which disproportionately harms poorer Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Also, consider the race issue here in terms of the mass incarceration of young (usually recent high school dropouts) drug dealers and drug addicts. (5) The higher-ups in gangs and drug cartels reap enormous profits. In turn, these illicit drug profits fund terrorism and increase the risk of state failure: \"drug revenues support insurgents, other armed non-state actors, and corrupt officials, while counternarcotic efforts create hostility to state power.\" [1] (6) In Mexico, drug gangs use advanced military equipment (often better than the army's), have taken over local governments, and some towns have even become uninhabitable. Tens of thousands of individuals have been violently killed, a number greater than the combined deaths of American and allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, including a considerable number of children and other innocent bystanders. [1] (7) Mexicans fleeing the drug violence have been entering the United States illegally. This has created an immigration problem. (It even gave Donald Trump something to talk about, which links to the risk of Trump winning the election). (8) The most dangerous harms are those we can't predict ahead-of-time. For example, a major cost of heroin prohibition was the rapid spread of HIV through drug injecting before anyone knew what was going on. Or consider the changes in inner-city drug trade as a result of the crack trade in the 90s, specifically the increase in gang violence, gun prevalence, and so on. Prohibited markets are unpredictable. And that has major risks on public health (e.g. HIV), crime (e.g. gang violence), and other social issues we simply can't predict. In effect, drug prohibition inflicts more harm to people in our cities, states, countries, and the world than drugs ever will. And each of these harms are eliminated or significantly reduced in a legalized regime. On top of that, legalization creates a number of other benefits: (1) Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard economist, estimates that legalization will reduce government expenditures by $41.3 billion per year. The savings involve reductions in police expenditures, in judicial expenditures, and in prison expenditures. In addition, Miron estimates that legalization will increase tax revenues by $46.7 billion per year, assuming conservatively that demand for drugs doesn't increase, with a tax rate similar to that on alcohol. The total boom to our economy is thus about $88 billion per year. And that calculation doesn't even take into account the potential income tax on legal drug dealers. [2]",

To further solidify, a 2005 study by Rosalie Pacula found that the availability of drugs affected the decision of people.

To further give you an idea of the potency in illicit drugs, * six times * as many people use alcohol compared to illicit drugs, yet people die from illicit drugs at 174% of the rate of alcohol deaths [8]. Alcohol is also a deadly drug, yet these illicit drugs are staggeringly more dangerous! Here are the effects of the more potent drugs: Heroin : According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in 2011, nearly a quarter (23%) of all people who tried heroin in their lives were addicted to it [5]. Addiction is so damaging that it is considered a mental disease [6]. There are said to be three results from addiction: (1)  tolerance  (meaning it takes more of the drug to get the same effect), (2)  dependence  (self-explanatory) and (3)  deterioration of white matter in the brain  (meaning in sharp decrease in decision-making, behaviour regulation and ability to cope with stressful situations). There are also other risk factors strongly associated with heroin, including: -          Overdose    -          *Comorbidity* (people who have drug addictions are at least two times more likely to incur a second mental disease)    -          Infection (sharing needles)    -          STDs (unprotected sex)    -          Collapsed veins    -          Infection of heart lining and/or valves    -          Abscesses    -          Liver and/or kidney disease",

I emphasise the ease in which all these things can happen  . This leaves the victim in a state where he/she could help the attacker  rape, steal, assault  or really anything, whilst the person is under the influence.

What this means for this debate is that there are, on average, 4 years in which young people can make some seriously bad decisions relating to some seriously harmful substances [1]. Until roughly the age of 25, what lacks in development is the prefrontal cortex. This means that [1]: -          Organised thinking is lacking, meaning that  hormones often influence decisions     -          Risk management is quite poor, meaning that  instant gratification will often take precedence over long-term rewards     -          Impulse control is low, meaning that  you are much more likely to give into urges which are detrimental to your well-being So, the impact is that  p  eople under 25  are  not in a position  to make these  potentially very harmful decisions , and thus  all drugs should be legal to them .",

Furthermore, from a self-report study (National Survey on Drug Use and Health), about  10.2 million  Americans self-reported driving under the influence of an illicit drug  during the past year. Keep in mind that this occurred when the drugs were illegal . Now, since people have been shown here to be unable to control themselves, please consider how A1 and A2 show how drugs are alter the state of mind drastically and how young people are quite poor at making important decisions. Now, amplify all of this with what can be used as a killing weapon: a car. To give this line of argument impact, in 2012, * more than *  one in three   (38%)   drivers killed in motor vehicle accidents tested positive for drugs  [2].

            "premise": " A3: Effect on society When someone destroys his/her life through drug abuse, it is not merely the individual that suffers, but his/her relatives, loved one, community and society, too. In terms of macro-economics, according to drugabuse.gov, in 2004, \u201c Illicit drug use in the United States is estimated to have  cost the U.S economy more than $193 billion  in 2007 \u201c[4]. It can be largely attributed to over 1,742,887 hospital emergency department drug misuse or abuse [8]. Comparatively,  merely $15 billion  is spent yearly on \u2018The War on Drugs\u2019, which as you can see, is not even close to a tenth of the healthcare costs illicit drug use inflicts on the American society yearly [9]. Thus, keeping the giant of drug abuse cost is OBVIOUSLY going to outweigh the relatively measly cost of maintaining a war on drugs. In terms of progress, for every $1 spent in curbing drug use, a return of $4 to $7 in \u201creduced drug-related crime, criminal justice cost and theft, is received [8].  If legalising drugs is a good idea, then why is it that curbing use brings returns as such ? According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, there are * six times * as many homicides committed by people under the influence of illicit substances  than those who are looking for money to buy drugs  [8].",

The main problem with legalizing drugs is it would lead to a massive increase in users, and make drugs easier to obtain [1]. Illegal drugs cost when they are illegal are much more expensive then when they are legal. All drugs which are currently illegal, cocaine, marijuana, PCP, meth etc. have higher prices now then they would be if they where legal. But many estimates argue drug prices would be 3 times lower, which is a large amount indeed. It would mean many would now be able to afford large quantities of the drugs, and when things cost less one is more likely to buy the item. A good example is food, or medicines. People usually opt for the over the counter generic brand then the name brand as it is cheaper. People opt for the cheaper brand of food for the same reason. Lower costs equal more people buying the substance. \"Legalization would decrease price and increase availability. Availability is a leading factor associated with increased drug use. Increased use of addictive substances leads to increased addiction. As a public health measure, statistics show that prohibition was a tremendous success.\"[2]",

The reason these drugs are currently illegal is because the government and society have decided drugs like these should not be freely legal as they are a threat not only the the user, but everyone around him. Legalizing drugs not only lowers the actual cost of the drug, which would lead to more users, but to lower costs to the person itself. In other words there is less cost of being mugged to get the drugs, getting arrested etc. It would lower the deterrent effect which is currently in place. When cocaine was restricted in the early 20th century, addicts and users fell as restrictions became more common. Many other drug experiments occurred in Europe, most of which lead to increases in users and crime. Many European countries are beginning to change their laws to a more stricter setting as the increase in usage outweighed the other legalization benefits [3].",

For example some are taller, longer life expectancy, and are more likely to have certain diseases later in life. People of race can fall into certain categories in society no matter the country. For example the Germans always have been lead piano makers no matter the country as studies have shown. But these differences do not in any sense qualify someone as inferior or superior. Now, a politician brought up that more hurricanes are named after whites than blacks and this is racist. Such is one of the many bad ways of using the world. Does she really believe that the people who name the hurricanes believe the whites are genetically superior than blacks. No, I believe she wants blacks to be more represented which is understandable, people take pride of who they are and what they are.

Danger to sex workers from both violence and disease increase when the go from a \u201cmanaged environment\u201d to \u201cprivate sector. \u201d \u2013 \u201cStreet-based workers were more likely . . . to report refusal of a client to pay, having had money stolen by a client, having been physically assaulted by a client, having been threatened by a client with physical violence, having been held against their will and having been raped in the last 12 months.\u201d     2. The sample was not a random. The majority of participants were white, \u201cbetween the ages of 22 to 45 years, had entered the industry after age 18, and had education levels of at least three to five years at the secondary school level with many having tertiary levels of education\u201d  \u2013  the New Zealand study is irrelevant to our situation where our demographic is much different.      3. Even with these survey participants, the picture is horrifying. For example     -   \u201c87% of all survey participants have a regular doctor but only half of these participants disclose their occupation to their doctor.\u201d This means  13% have no doctor at all , and  51% have not told a doctor that they are in the sex trade.",

More workers in the sex trade places more people at risk.  An American study[8] found that  prostitutes are 200 times more likely to die  (when adjusted for age and race).

These felonies can include murder, bombings or rape. Don't you believe that criminals should be responsible for their actions? According to Constitutional Lawyer and General Counsel to the Center for Law and Accountability, \"The crimes of rape, torture, treason, kidnapping, murder, larceny, and perjury pivot on a moral code that escapes apodictic [indisputably true] proof by expert testimony or otherwise.

Abolitionists may contend that the death penalty is inherently immoral because governments should never take human life, no matter what the provocation. But that is an article of faith, not of fact. The death penalty honors human dignity by treating the defendant as a free moral actor able to control his own destiny for good or for ill; it does not treat him as an animal with no moral sense.\" The criminals should not be kept in the jails. They deserve to die, not live. Its a matter of fact that after these criminals murdered so many people, the US government should put then to death. My second assertion is that people should get what they deserve. Once those men have committed a crime, they have done an unforgivable act. These men and women deserve to be punished by the government. Life in prison would not be enough. According to Professor of Government and Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin, \"Society is justly ordered when each person receives what is due to him. Crime disturbs this just order, for the criminal takes from people their lives, peace, liberties, and worldly goods in order to give himself undeserved benefits. Deserved punishment protects society morally by restoring this just order, making the wrongdoer pay a price equivalent to the harm he has done. This is retribution, not to be confused with revenge, which is guided by a different motive. In retribution the spur is the virtue of indignation, which answers injury with injury for public good... Retribution is the primary purpose of just punishment as such... rehabilitation, protection, and deterrence have a lesser status in punishment than retribution.\"",

            "premise": " Deterrence My opponent starts off his deterrence section by not knowing how to properly use and utilize statistics. Saying that \"88%\" of criminologists say the death penalty is not a deterrent. However if you actually read things in detail, you can see this is misleading.[3] These criminologists were asked to set opinions aside and look at what the empirical data suggests. If asked instead does the empirical evidence support that the death penalty is definitely not a deterrent, you may have gotten a similarly high number. The reason for this is because the scientific consensus up until 2012 was represented in the a national research council study: \"The committee concludes that re- search to date is not informative about whether capital punishment decreases, increases, or has no effect on homicide rates.   [4] However this doesn\"t address some of the lesser known studies done on this subject as well as studies conducted after 2012. Studies I\"ll mention. Pro goes on to argue that because murder rates and crime rates are lower in non death penalty states that it must mean the death penalty has no deterrent effect. This is untrue. Maybe rednecks in the red states most likely to implement the death penalty are just more prone to fly off the handle, or maybe people in low crime areas feel safe so they feel like they can be more merciful to criminals. The states that have higher murder rates also tend to lead the nation in domestic violence as well, and it\"s possible wife beaters are more inclined to support the death penalty. All that speculation is beyond the scope of this debate. There are two types of deterrence we need to look at. The first was mentioned in the prior round. If we removed most or all of the people doing life without parole we could eliminate their contribution to the problem with inmates murdering each other. To state the obvious, if these people aren\"t around to kill other inmates, they can\"t kill other inmates. If you remember in the previous round I stated that we could prevent up to 5 of these killings a year by making the death penalty more common and happen at a faster rate. The first type of deterrence is removing murderers from existence so they are rendered physically incapable of murdering. The second type of deterrence is preventing people from murdering to start with. If there were some periods of time in states where the death penalty was used and then not used and then used again, could we hope to compare the murder rates before and during and after these periods to see correlation. Hold on, there was a time when this occurred. There was a moratorium set on murders by the Supreme Court several years ago where we observed an increase in murders in death penalty areas, followed by a decrease in murders once the moratorium went away. We also have periods of time where the death penalty was more common than other times, where we can study the effects of increasing and decreasing the number of murderers killed. Below is an excerpt from a previous debate I done on the topic excluding citations which can be found in that debate. [5] Studies have been done to show that as many as 18 lives are saved per execution [1]. \"In the early 1980s, the return of the death penalty was associated with a drop in the number of murders. In the mid-to-late 1980s, when the number of executions stabilized at about 20 per year, the number of murders increased. Throughout the 1990s, our society increased the number of executions, and the number of murders plummeted. Since 2001, there has been a decline in executions and an increase in murders.\"[2} At the time some people thought this could be coincidence so a regression analysis was done and showed that there was less than a 1 in 18,000 chance that the correlation was random. Pretty much any study on the death penalty you look at since the 90s shows that the death penalty and actual execution have a real deterrent effect and actually saves lives. [2][3][4][5] Cass Sunstein writes \" If the recent evidence of deterrence is ultimately shown to be correct, then opponents of capital punishment will face an uphill struggle on moral grounds. If each execution saves many innocent lives, the harms of capital punishment would have to be very great to justify its abolition\"[6] My opponent may show a number of death penalty states where it seems that deterrence isn't working but A recent study offers more refined findings. \"Disaggregating the data on a state-by-state basis, Joanna Shepherd finds that the nationwide deterrent effect of capital punishment is entirely driven by only six states\"and that no deterrent effect can be found in the twenty-one other states that have restored capital punishment. What distinguishes the six from the twenty-one? The answer, she contends, lies in the fact that states showing a deterrent effect are executing more people than states that are not.\"",

Indemnification is where whenever there are legal fees levied against a police officer because of a civil suit or something similar, the municipality covers the bill instead, meaning that the officer doesn't receive any kind of punishment. If officers aren't being punished for doing really bad things and violating the rights of citizens, then there's no reason for them to change how they're acting - even if we're putting them in trials and not giving them QI protection, they're still not facing any of the reprocussions of their actions because the municipalities take the hit for them. This means that even if we do things exactly how Hayd wants it to the letter, there's still not going to be any kind of perception shift of the police force beacuse officers aren't going to have any reason to change how they act - they're not being punished even with less QI protecting them, so why change how they work?",

Not only that, but a company holding a special event shouldn't consitute the abolishment of the company.

Second, I'd like to ask my opponent for an alternative. Take the Chicago Police force for instance. With Chicago's immense crime rate, would you say that they are ineffective?

Therefore, if anyone is to blame for breeding a false sense of terror, it would be the government and media. However, there is no false sense of danger. There is a real sense of danger, and there has been ever since 9/11. What my opponent is apparently convinced of is that the world of air travel is the exact same as it was before 9/11, which all of us know is not true. I sympathies with my opponent when he says he is reminded of 9/11 whenever he passes a TSA checkpoint, but I must stress that ignorance is not bliss. All because the checkpoint isn't there doesn't mean the danger isn't there, an <<<conclusion>>> The TSA is one of the only defenses we as a country have against another 9/11.

In addition, The Law of Biogenesis, attributed to Louis Pasteur, states that life (life as we know it) arises from pre-existing life, not from nonliving material. Both these physical laws together indicate that whatever is responsible for this complexity and beginning must have been an eternal life force without Spacial and Temporal properties who consciously designed carbon based life forms along with the universe itself. It must be eternal and therefore changeless without the universe because it created time. Since it also created space, it must transcend space as well and must therefore be immaterial not physical. Lastly, it must be a personal mind since the DNA contains information and information or language only comes from minds . Thus, the properties of this cause would be omni-present, eternal, and immaterial as well as a personal being.",

Abstract objects like numbers or the logical absolutes cannot be found under rocks or grown out of trees nor are they contingent upon human minds. Our minds simply recognize these necessary truths rather than create them. Nevertheless, these kind of abstract objects are still demonstrable because we can create physical manifestations of them in reality like mathematical models and the fine-tuning constants. Human minds are understood to have agent causality where a cause would be able to bring about new effects at will without any physical dimensions or determining conditions by virtue of its agency. This is called \"substance dualism\" where there are two fundamental kinds of substance: mental and material. The mental would not have extension in the spacial and temporal constraints with the universe but occupy an independent \"realm\" of existence distinct from that of the physical world [1]. However, abstract objects by definition do not stand in casual relationships, and human minds are understood to be intrinsically connected to material substances that naturally possess physical constraints on knowledge and power. Thus, if it cannot be an abstract object or a human mind, then maybe its a combination of the two which would involve an absolute mind where there would not be a brain or body attached. A personal absolute mind would explain why you can get a temporal effect with a beginning from an eternal cause with unlimited properties. We should find from more empirical observations attributes of an all-knowing and all-powerful being exhibited within the universe.",

This is attributed to the cancellation effect between negative and positive energy ,called the cosmological constant [2], which happens to be finely tuned to 120 decimal places making it the most well adjusted fine-tuning parameter of them all. Since this constant as well as the rest were present from the very beginning of the universe, it follows logically that the cause for this beginning was responsible for the fine-tuning of the cosmological constant [3] as well. Thus, the attributes of this cause must be omni-potent Moreover, If this cause is all-powerful, then it would have to be all-knowing as well to know the position and velocity of every particle in the universe, the potential outcome of all future interactions of the particles, and be able to control and anticipate each potential outcome from this future eternal inflation in a inconceivably precise manner.

Once scientists discover a successful Grand Unified Theory, there is still the remote possibility that the fine-tuning constants like the Cosmological constant are mere accidents given other laws of physics. 2. Life from Non-life The Miller Urey-experiment attempted to prove the origin of life (as we know it) could have occurred on the early earth under natural conditions without intelligence, but the experiment actually provided compelling evidence for exactly the opposite conclusion [4]. The reasons why creating life in a test tube turned out to be far more difficult than Miller or anyone else expected are numerous and include the fact that scientists now know that the complexity of life is far greater than Miller or anyone else in pre-DNA revolution 1953 ever imagined. Actually life is far more complex and contains far more information than anyone in the 1980s believed possible. Therefore, the Urey/Miller experiments did not produce evidence for abiogenesis because, although amino acids are the building blocks of life, the key to life is information in the form of DNA.",

            "premise": " 3. Mind-Body Dualism Let me provide some context first. Obviously, much of what happens in our minds is influenced by what happens in our bodies and I fully acknowledged this when I mentioned that human minds are intrinsically connected. However, not everything that goes on in our minds is causally determined by what goes on in our bodies. Sometimes what goes on in our bodies is a result of what goes on in our minds. For example, the movements of my fingers as I type this response is ultimately produced by my mental events. Here we have mental-to-physical causation. What explains both this choice of mine and the physical events in my body that are ultimately produced by this choice? The explanation is the purpose that I provide a response to CON's objections. A purposeful explanation is a teleological explanation. In addition, free will is also a mental event. We can make decisions apart from what the brain and body tells us. For example, I have the choice to act upon my emotional desire to have sex after marriage and negate my basic biological desire to have sex before it. Here we have mental versus physical properties. This also would include things like self-identity overtime. A famous scientist named Wilder Penfield conducted studies that are consistent with my point that choices can be undetermined events with a teleological explanation. In his fascinating book The Mystery of the Mind, he writes the following [5]: 'When I have caused a conscious patient to move his hand by applying an electrode to the motor cortex of one hemisphere, I have often asked him about it. Invariably his response was: \"I didn't do that. You did\". When I caused him to vocalize, he said:\" I didn't make that sound\". You pulled it out of me.

He counters this claim by contending that that genes express themselves more as organisms grow. This is actually completely false. All genes do not automatically express themselves as an individual becomes older; instead, different genes are expressed according to the period of development that the organism is undergoing. For example, different genes are expressed during puberty in women than in menopause. As the study cited in subpoint B notes, the critical period of development for the human brain is within the first two years of life, meaning that IQ development genes are most present at that time. So, since IQ heritability is only 0.2 during infancy, the period of critical development of intelligence, we can assume that intelligence is mostly affected by the environment over time; it is not controlled by genetics. This is directly in line with the dropped Neisser analysis in point A, which explicitly states that heritability is higher in adults because individuals often associate with others who are perceived to be of similar intelligence/the environment, specifically the culture from which one stems is the most important factor in shaping IQ.",

However, he ignores the LSUAgCenter statistic, which explicitly states that 30% of African American children reside in a home without access to an adequately nutritious diet, meaning that malnutrition is higher in African Americans than Caucasians. This, as I noted in my previous speech, this links malnutrition with the African American population and drags down their average IQ.

In fact, he cleverly attempts to turn the argument by contending that Caucasian teenagers use drugs more than African American teenagers do. Unfortunately, he ignores the Department of Health evidence that notes that African Americans are more likely to have used illicit drugs than Caucasians are. Moreover, his statistic is unfair because it only takes into account drug abuse among teenagers. If we examine the population as a whole, including the adult population (which he claimed in his last speech was the only valid population to test IQ in), African Americans are more likely to be exposed to drugs than Caucasians. So, we can see that the true IQ of African Americans is not measured in intelligence tests for this reason as well.",

In the fourth, Tizard found that African American children and biracial children have a higher IQ (109.8 vs. 101.3) than Caucasian children. I then provided a second study, the Eyeferth study, that found the same results as the first three Tizard studies. Remember that I gave you two impacts for these dropped studies: first, African Americans are not less intelligent than Caucasians. Second, and more importantly, African American children are actually more intelligent than Caucasian children.

He attempts to use the study to show that even when placed a similar environment, African American children had less intelligence than Caucasian children. Unfortunately for him, the study is notorious for having serious flaws that even the authors admit to. First, the study was conducted in 1976, a period in our history noted for rampant racism. The educational environment for African Americans was, and still is, repressive, leading to a deemphasis on the importance of education as a tool for success. Scarr and Weinberg, the authors of the study, themselves concede that the racism still existed and affected the participants of the study, and that the study only controlled for family environment, and not social environment.",

Second, as Scarr and Weinberg note, the selection methods for African American and biracial children was completely different from that of Caucasian children. They concede, \" It is essential to note, however, that the groups also differed significantly (p < .05) in their placement histories and natural mother's education. Children with two black parents were significantly older at adoption, had been in the adoptive home a shorter time, and had experienced a greater number of preadoption placements. The natural parents of the black/black group also averaged a year less of education than those of the black/white group, which suggests an average difference between the groups in intellectual ability. There were also significant differences between the adoptive families of black/black and black/white children in father's education and mother's IQ .\" (Same source as above.) If this is true, then African American children that were already less intelligent than the Caucasian children were selected for in this study, meaning that it has sampling errors that mitigate its use as a proper scientific tool. Perhaps most damningly, in 1994 the authors of the study themselves countered claims that this study could be used to prove racial differences in intelligence by noting, \". . . contrary to Levin's and Lynn's assertions, results from the Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study provide little or no conclusive evidence for genetic influences underlying racial differences in intelligence and achievement.\" (Same source as above.) Richard Nesbitt further discusses concessions by Scarr and Weinberg, noting that another flaw in the study is that the African American children studied were known by the authors to have \". . . an unusual degree of psychological disturbance having to do with identity issues\"",

My mistake, this was a fact error on my part. I was thinking of the most famous latitude/longitude lines. TGPOG doesn\u2019t go through the equator and prime meridian, but rather           Anyone with the ability to notice that the sun rises in the East and sets in the West can line up an object with the cardinals.     The Egyptians knew about true north [1]? Unlikely.     It took 20 years, but this isn\u2019t unreasonable as I will show.     This has not been shown, I invite my opponent to tell us about how ancient humans dragged millions of ton-block stones up mile long ramps, fitted them so perfectly a knife can\u2019t go between them, and did all the ornate marble works within the pyramid in ONLY 20 years.     85% if the pyramids stones were made of soft stand-stone which was cut on site. The larget stones were dug out of the ground, lifted with levers onto a sled, dragged to a boad, and shipped via the Nile.     Once again our facts differ. The Pyramid of Giza was composed of roughly 2.3 million limestone blocks which came from nearby quarries, not cut on site. The largest stone weighed 25 \u2013 80 tonnes and was transported to TGPOG from Aswan, which was 500 miles away. It is believed that 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8000 tonnes of granite (all coming from Aswan) and 500 000 tons of mortar were used in the construction of TGPOG. [4] All of this between 10-20 years? And I\u2019ve only touched on the major issues, I haven\u2019t even mentioned that the Egyptians somehow got the perimeter to height ration to be almost EXACTLY 2pi.     Furthermore, most of the worlds major pyramids have very similar perimeters.     This isn\u2019t spectacular? These cultures have never contacted each other, but somehow their structures are the same perimeter? Possibly the aliens gave this pyramid building knowledge to these civilizations.     Your picture has been doctored to make it look like the pyramids line up in a significant way, when really all you\u2019ve done is draw a line through the pyramids and claimed they line up the same way. You can do that with literally any 2 objects if you pay no attention to distance.     Well I click on the link, it just brings me to Google maps. Could you please elaborate on how you came up with these numbers?     Which ones? And how is that possible given that where the other planets are located relative to the Earth constantly changes given that each planet is in constant motion along several axises?     My mistake, this was an incorrect fact from the Ancient Astronomy Theory YouTube Videos, parts 1- 9. However, many of the degree of alignments in Teotihuacan in general line up to 15.5 degrees. [4] The city is 15.5 degrees off from the cardinal directions. The Street of the Dead funs from 15.5 degrees east of north to 15.5 degrees west of south. The pyramid of the sun is 15.5 degrees north of west, need I go on? This 15.5 degree alignment puts the Pyramid of the Sun and Moon in line with the Sun on August 13 th .

And the last was a man who was viciously attacked by a gang and beaten. Out of self-defense, this man pulls a pistol and fires, killing a gang member. Also, lets just say if these men are found guilty, they'll all be subject to the death penalty. Now, the question today is, should all these men be charged with the same crime, all three seen as equal under the law, all three condemned to death on a technical issue? The technical issue being the law said killing is frowned upon. Or should the constitutionally protected process of jury nullification come into play? Jury nullification consists of two aspects or ways to conduct it. One being in a specific case the law should be disregarded.

Professor John Van Dyke, from the University of Hawaii-Manoa, says that in some cases Jury nullification may be that ONLY way for the public to express opposition to an unjust law. This shows that jury nullification is the best check on the government, because at times, it is the only voice the public has. CONTENTION ONE: Jury nullification, in its principle and application, serves as both a legitimate and just check on the government. SUB POINT A: The principle and application of jury nullification serves as a just check on the power of the government. Jury nullification is intended to protect the defendant and ultimately people abroad. Professor James Duane at the Regent's Law School of Virginia asserts that applying the letter of the law in all of its generality to every situation may not be appropriate. Ultimately, the law does not equal justice thus the only way to legitimately administer justice is through jury nullification. Without Jury nullification the people of the United States would be lacking this legitimate and just check on the power of the government.",

Some opponents of jury nullification would say that it is an unwarranted and dangerous power, not designated to the people by the constitution. On the contrary, jury nullification is: a perfectly constitutional and legitimate means of administering justice. Granted, nowhere in the constitution does it explicitly say the words JURY NULLIFICATION, however, Professor John Van Dyke said, \"The framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against arbitrary action\u2026\" Clearly jury nullification is perfectly within the spirit of the constitution. It is much like the concept of freedom of expression, nowhere in the constitution does it say these words, however, freedom of expression is at the very core of our American values yet, is not in the constitution; it is inferred, but not explicitly stated. Beyond this, according to assistant Professor Andrew D. Leipold at the University of Illinois, jury nullification intervenes in situations where old, and often irrelevant laws, resurface. Jury nullification corrects these laws and ultimately legitimizes the system. The legitimate administration of justice and ultimately liberty cannot exist without jury nullification.",

There are times when laws are unfair and unjust. Carrie Ullman from the Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics supports this saying that, \"jury nullification can be a useful corrective tool in situations where the interests of justice and strict compliance with the law do not necessarily coincide.\" Jury nullification renders justice in these instances by administering it in ways that are out of the power of the judge. This position is illustrated by Professor Alan Scheflin from Santa Clara University saying that a jury can administer justice in ways that a judge cannot.",

On one hand, hybrids can harness the credibility of international law and the legitimacy of international institutions, which can lend hybrid courts a degree of authority as a fair mechanism for holding perpetrators accountable. On the other hand, hybrids can be structured to tap into domestic expertise, connect with local populations, and rebuild national judicial systems, creating a training ground for rule of law values. They also avoid the staggering costs of purely international courts. By integrating local norms, hybrid courts can bring culturally adapted justice to the people that international courts purport to serve but cannot reach; they can bridge the divide between remote, wealthy international jurists and third world victims of war crimes.",

            "premise": " Value: Human Rights -Look to my first contention. The ICC's unchecked power will prevent it from properly upholding rights. There is no way an unchecked international institution can properly uphold rights. Hybrid courts, on the other hand, have the benefits of international courts, and the benefits of local authority. They have checks in their power, and help rebuild a country's judicial system (like judicial training wheels). Value Criterion: Cosmopolitanism -I don't seem to understand my opponent's attack. Valuing humans as citizens makes sure you protect the rights bestowed upon them by the government, as well as their human rights. Valuing them as humans only guarantees human rights (in this context, that means no guarantee to fair trial, protection from double jeopardy etc.). When you value people as citizens, you uphold more rights. Dictators value people as nothing. If they were valued as citizens, they'd be given rights. Contention One - I have shown that the ICC has unchecked power and fails in local context. How is such an entity beneficial at all? With unchecked power, the ICC would carry out illegitimate decisions. Because it ignores local context, there is no way it can succeed. While international institutions are beneficial, the ICC is not. Hybrid courts, however, are beneficial. Contention Two -By joining the ICC, the U.S. would show the world irresponsibility. If you look at our governmental system with its checks and balances, and the ICC's with unrestrained power, there is no rational reason the U.S. would become part of such an entity. However, hybrid courts, which have an international arm and a local arm would be far better to join. The U.S. should not legitimize an illegitimate organization whose judicial system is on the other end of the spectrum. While joining the ICC would legitimize it, the U.S. should legitimize an illegitimate organization. The U.S. would be better off joining an organization like a hybrid court.",

The problem with this is that if they will now have the option of no relationship or forcing their way on someone. If someone has been rehabilitated and is then thrust into this situation I would suggest their odds of reverting to their former state rises. Thankfully the rate of recidivism is, as previously stated, very low, but it would seem that the registry is more likely to raise the rate of recidivism than lower it. The registry does not really protect anyone, it is just extra punishment beyond the prison time that the offenders serve. These offenders have already served their time, and if qualified professionals (ie psychiatrists) think a person is still likely to be a danger to society but has served his sentence, he should be getting therapy to treat his disorder and possibly confined in some way(eg a tracking ankle bracelet or confinement to a facility to treat these offenders).

If you want to eradicate poverty, you have to deal with one person or group controlling too many scarce resources, which is the inevitable result if money is concentrated into the hands of only a few \"haves\" instead of a majority of \"have nots\". The prosperous society he describes is one governed by a ruling elite - both because control of money means control of resources, allowing certain individuals to regulate who gets what, and because with wealth comes the power to lobby governments to certain ends.",

What you'd find if there was more equality in the world is that companies who provide food, clothing and other necessities would have a lot more wealth to help more poor people, while companies who provide luxuries like private jets are likely to have a lot less to help rich people. The point is that companies are still getting income for things like large capital projects - only from a different source, and by different means - if governments choose equality over prosperity.",

The existance of a ruling class is proof that a government cares for prosperity over equality, despite what that government's rhetoric may be. It is perfectly possible to institute a fair and objective system for redistributing wealth, and yet these governments refuse. An example would be progressive income tax, where earning more means you pay a higher tax rate. That's not redistributing according to elitist values, that's redistributing according to an objective measure. If the government \"redistributers\" started to become wealthy, then they would be taxed at the higher rate too. In this way they don't control the resources either.",

Free markets provide no incentives for either. Con asserts rich people have reason to invest in a free market, and yet his own data shows they have relatively little happiness to gain as a result, and a lot of happiness to lose, meaning that in a free market the incentive is not to invest.

This is because he has defined poverty in terms of outputs, such as food and housing. The Stanford Center for the Study of Poverty and Inequality shows that while output in GDP per worker has increased massively in the US, the median income hasn't increased a bit since 1970 ( http://www.stanford.edu... ). That's bad because there has been significant inflation since that time, so in terms of purchasing power, US poverty has increased massively. Poverty has not decreased, or remained the same. It has increased at more or less the rate of inflation, while inequality has certainly increased.",

It will take some time before issues of poverty in China mean investment slows, and we're already seeing the first signs of that. For instance, Apple's scandel when workers at the Foxconn factory at Zhengzhou suicided will inevitably mean investors will be more cautious about moving into China, and even the US government has expressed some concern ( http://www.bbc.com... ). In addition, what incentive do these workers have for entrepreneurship, or to increase their productivity? None.

Interventionism, especially, is a government policy of exerting influence over things not under it's direct control. However, I intend to meet my opponent's challenge and not only point out his inadvertent forfeiture but to actually prove that America is now, and has historically been, imperialist. Read on. My opponent will have to maintain that the U.S. has never expanded its territories, let alone attempted to expand it's influence, to win this debate. Whether any nation can be called imperialist is irrelevant. Any human can be called mortal, this hardly makes the label untrue. Finally, whether any imperialist action is justified is entirely irrelevant. There is no moral judgment inherent in the term.",

The French, British, Spanish and even the Netherlands have all been successful imperialists to one degree or another, indisputably. All that is required for America to be imperialist is for it to fit the definition. INTRODUCTION TO US IMPERIALISM From it's very beginnings, before the U.S. was even severed from British control, American settlers pushed for direct territorial acquisitions. Once a nation, Americans began a long and slow push for land justified by their \"Divine Mandate\" not only westward but in the south and north as well. Its first acquisition was in 1783, the last in 1970. [1] In addition, the U.S. has attempted to exert control over other areas of the world politically and militarily. ORIGINS In fact, this was a factor in strained British-American and Indian-American relations. Early American settlers were mostly tobacco farmers, requiring more land for more profits, so they pushed into Indian territory, one example being Bacon's Rebellion. [2] EARLY IMPERIALISM Once the nation was solidified, the infamous march westward began, as the new nation slowly took Indian territory. Less known is the expansion to the south and north. For example, in the Mexican-American War, the U.S. took almost half of all Mexican territory, creating what is now the American Southwest. [3][4] It also purchased Alaska and continued to expand west, taking land from natives. Later, the American-Spanish War would mark the beginning of overseas expansion. GLOBAL CONFLICTS While the U.S. did not initially get involved militarily in WWI, it exerted its influence by supporting those already involved. They also attempted to impose their influence during the Russian Revolution. [5] And early on in WWII, America attempted to influence events by quietly providing support to its allies. The Cold War, of course, marks a major and long-term imperialist war by the U.S., as the entire point of the Cold War was influence and power. The U.S. exerted control via aid (long one of it's favorite tactics) and military support/intervention, as well as through the threat of nuclear war. [6] From there, you have numerous instances of America gaining and exerting political control, including: the Korean War (supporting pro-America allies), the Lebanon Crisis (supporting pro-America forces), and the Vietnam War (supporting pro-American forces). [7] MODERN IMPERIALISM Modern U.S. imperialism has continued its tactics of indirect control and small military intervention, either through support or direct conflict. [8][9][13][14] It has quietly supported foreign regimes whose policies are in its favor, and deposed those which are not. [10][11] In addition to these smaller, lesser-known acts of intervention and control, the recent \"War on Terrorism\" is a blatant and obvious show of interventionism. In addition to the war generally being interventionist, America has attempted to push pro-American Western ideals, forms of government, and even governments itself on affected countries. Currently, the departments of foreign affairs, including the Secretary of State admits, unknowingly, that it is imperialist. It's self-admitted policy is one of exerting influence for noble goals, and though it's doubtful whether the stated reasons are true, it doesn't matter. [12] The goal of American foreign policy is stated as working on \"export controls, including nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware; measures to foster commercial intercourse with foreign nations and to safeguard American business abroad; International commodity agreements; international education; and protection of American citizens abroad and expatriation\". Imperialism is \"the policy, practice, or advocacy of extending the power and dominion of a nation especially by direct territorial acquisitions or by gaining indirect control over the political or economic life of other areas; broadly : the extension or imposition of power, authority, or influence\". <<<conclusion>>> CONCLUSION America has long made territory acquisitions. It has long attempted to influence and control other areas more directly. Even today, foreign policy is a major factor in American politics and even a factor in voters' minds. Resolution affirmed: America is and has historically been imperialist.",

Taxation can be a pocket pain, but overall is not a compelling enough argument to lead into anarchy.

You never answer the important problems. My main question, is that in order for this legal system to be put in place, there must be a standard for determining what is right, and what is wrong, is there not? Or is that standard to be made freely by the composers of Justice? That's why I associate your volunteer group with \"vigilantes\". Here's the thing; you really that a code of justice must be utilized in order to sustain the benefits of justice, and protection of human rights. The problem is you have a hard time tying that into making anarchism works, as monopolies are commonly associated with organized groups. So when you respond without a proposal or plan of action, it seems as if you are making a statement that simply carries no weight, or warrant. So we agree a means of keeping justice in place is required. If you detest your volunteer group be associated as vigilantes, then you must believe in some sort of moral code that needs to be sustained in their duties. That's where the problem lies. In fact your volunteer group is more dangerous than any legal system America has in place, due to un-stability. In order to manufacture a system that can be equally fair, and upholding of every one's values, a system of order needs to be effective. A leaderless group of people hoping to do right, just make a mess of things, and violate people's freedom. A standard needs to be set. The standard in our government is not perfect, but it is effective in stopping crime, and protecting human rights, and thus meets the qualifications as a benefit to law enforcement. All your volunteer group can ever accomplish is vigilantism. Again, A system and explanation for your pre-supposed planned would be appreciated.  Also @ the one world government argument. No I am not arguing for one world government. I never said other systems work perfectly either. I am talking about a system where a majority can reach a conclusion on the fairness of enforcement (democracy). What exactly do you do in a situation where there is no standard of agreement? The Democracy is the most effective solution with law enforcement as it accomplishes the greatest good for the greatest amount of people, where a systemless rag tag group of volunteering anarchists, can never compare.",

In anarchism, there can never really be a plan, as having a plan to stabilize anarchism defeats the point. That's where most of my enthusiasm at the hypocrisy of the Instigators ideals on reform anarchism comes in so deeply.  Democracy has benefits that Anarchism couldn't hope to do.  In a Democracy, people have the power to vote on any politician, with various issues that take effect on societal well being. The fate of the country lies then, inside of the hands of a majority of like minded people who find fairness actions taken. This cannot hope to be accomplished in an anarchist society. Lives cannot be influenced, helped, or sustained through the lack of a system. Anarchism relies on people relying on themselves for survival.

People who contemplate euthanasia usually do so because they may be terminally ill or posses an incurable disease, that being said, their state of mind is thought not to be a 100% because they are dying and even if family is involved in the decision it is still not a fool proof solution as the family might have economic problems and opt for the easier solution or chose euthanasia simple to get rid of him/her. No should have the right to kill themselves or others , because it is a very illogical thing to legislate to a tiny proportion of society in comparison to the larger proportion. it is said \" hard cases make bad law\", euthanasia is often misleadingly linked to the phrase \"right to die\" (even pro has fallen into that pit), as it is not exactly the right to die at all... it's actually a right (if it actually is a right) to be killed by a doctor ... hence assisted suicide. Allowing difficult cases to create a precedent for legalised killing is the wrong response. We need rather to evaluate these difficult cases so that we can do better in the future. This was clearly demonstrated in the case of Nigel Cox, the Winchester rheumatologist found guilty of attempted murder after giving a patient with rheumatoid arthritis a lethal injection of potassium chloride in August 1991. Had he been willing to consult those specialised in pain management, he could have relieved his patient's symptoms without killing her.[2] If errors of omission are acknowledged, changes can be made.",

It is a key exception for the federal government to defend the nation against large organized enemies, whether they break the law or not. That is not the only citation that Con presented but seemingly failed to pay any serious attention to.

Con's position therefore favors a complete handover of American land to the Native American race. If the DAPL protesters agree with him, and by all signs they do(8), then this would make the DAPL protesters enemies of the American colonies, and a declaration of war is justified. I would assume that Con means to cede ALL of the USA to the Native Americans, all such land being previously 100% Native American territory, except he clarified to limit his position to ceding only the land of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. It is hardly a compromise, as the land covers all of western South Dakota, most of the NW quadrant of Nebraska, most of the NE quadrant of Wyoming, and some of both Montana and North Dakota(1). Under Con's legal principle, any Native American sufficiently descended from tribes of that respective land would be free to take the possesson of any house otherwise belonging to a White, Black, Asian or Hispanic, on any property within that land, and to thus change the locks. Luckily for almost all residents of that region, an established legal principle exists to prevent such a thing: obsolescence. According to Black's Law Dictionary(3), \"OBSOLETE\" is defined as: \"That which is no longer used... The term is applied to statutes which have become inoperative by large lapse of time, either because the reason for their enactment has passed away, or their subject-matter no longer exists, or they are not applicable to changed circumstances, or are tacitly disregarded by all men, yet without being expressly abrogated or repealed.\" The equivalent legal principle concerns treaties, termed, \"Rebus Sic Stantibus,\" defined as, \"A name given to a tacit condition, said to attach to all treaties, that they shall cease to be obligatory so soon as the state of facts and conditions upon which they were founded has substantially changed\"(4). Such \"changed circumstances\" would include the establishment of five states of the USA without regard to the boundaries per that treaty, a treaty that was likewise seldom observed by the Native American party(2). Con's citation of the treaty is therefore absurd at best, but he is not alone. The DAPL protesters tend to share this argument from the 165-year-old treaty(5), as they seem to observe no limit to the level of absurdity in their racially motivated legal arguments.",

If the DAPL protesters agree with Con (and, again, they seemingly do(6)), then it is a socially-systemic disregard of American colonial law, and the most appropriate response is enforcement through war.",

Second, \"Vigilantism, Vigilante Justice, and Self-Help\" explains, \"Vigilante justice is sometimes too swift and too sure.

[3] It is necessary to consider what the consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran would be. The willingness of the Israeli government to take preemptive military action against a nuclear-armed Iran is a given. [4] Additionally, a nuclear-armed Shia Iran would likely encourage the Sunni-led governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia to revive long-dormant weapons programs. [3] One must also consider the potential \"black swan\" events that could give rise to instability in Iran -- ISIS represents a present territorial and religious threat to Iran's government, and the 2009 Green Revolution illustrated the diminished hold the regime has on its citizens.

Note that the NIE findings indicated that Iran suspended its  covert  (and clearly illegal) enrichment operations - its  overt  operations have remained a legitimate point of concern for the west, as it has ramped up from a \"pilot\" program to industrial-level production. [5] In 2012, the UN Int'l Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran had begun producing nuclear fuel at a protected mountain facility insulated from potential air strikes - although ostensibly for civilian purposes, the location and security of the facility means that rapid conversion to weaponization could take place quickly without much capacity for the west to halt weaponization short of direct military intervention. [6] Iran has also refused to allow international inspections at military sites suspected of developing warhead designs and trigger devices. [7] During the course of P5 + 1 negotiations, Iran has missed disclosure deadlines to answer questions about its prior weaponization efforts, and its work on long-range-ballistic-missile delivery systems has continued unimpeded. [8] In short, Iran\u2019s efforts to hide its nuclear facilities have intensified doubts about Iran's intentions, even though little evidence of an active weapons program has been recently detected.",

While a comprehensive deal has always been a daunting challenge - and the talks are more likely to fail than succeed - a deal that alleviates sanctions for Iran while minimizing the risks that Iran can revive a clandestine nuclear weapons program would alleviate regional tensions that have come closing to snapping more than once in recent years. A successful deal could also help thaw the long-standing tension between the U.S. and Iran, leading to the possibility of a peaceful partnership in the future.

While waiting for the court\"s judgment, she was permitted to run up charges at local stores and taverns\"and her husband had to pay for them. Judges consistently applied this rule, called the doctrine of necessities, in order to prevent men from neglecting their wives.\" [3] People were being idiots, but not because of misogyny, but rather because that was the best system they had. Women were not forced to work (which is seen as a desirable thing for example in World War one, when they had a reduced military troop size, because they let men work the factories and fight, so that the women didn't have to) and were provided for by their husband or father who did go to work.

There's no data that suggests this. I mean even the countries with the lowest gun crime and the tightest controls and the best mentality for those controls have gun crime, so obviously there will be gun crime, but the notion that it will somehow maintain itself and there will be a super-wave of criminals reaching out and grabbing magazines by the ton just seems less and less likely as we look at the data and really analyze it.",

And although the conduct was poor, this ignores the scandals in which the people prosecuted for it, and furthermore, ignores the JWT. Even then, it's once again an appeal to hypocracy and is irrelevant. There will always be unintentional deaths in War, what matters is the intention in which it takes place.

The UN can only make recommendations, not enforce the laws it's self, that it requires on it's members. Canada's handling of the native pop. is an example of this. Furthermore, as noted earlier the cases of Yugoslavia, Nuremburg, Eichmann, etc.. All put the genocide conventions in context, that an \"exception\" can be made legally for the party enforcing the law, so long as other means have been tried. The Iraqi Oil for food program didn't work, what esle was there? Invasion. Iraq didn't despute it's legitimacy, nor did it make an exception to the conventions to recognize her constitution over those docs when signing (as noted earlier) case and point, the competent UN organs can be consulted, but the US did simply by using the Conventions. Finally the JWT may use any of those justifications for invasion, I make the case for military necessity due to the pragmatic application of war, a general would be a fool to invade and expect so much as 1 civillian casualty to be criminal, it realistically isn't possible when all other means were tried and death still resulted espescially in the Iraqi Oil program. What else was there? Death by being idle? Or death via invasion for liberation?",

Second, its general application has failed to produce victory in at least 3 wars.

Air strikes in Iraq, most notably the airstrike that killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, did not cause the Iraqi insurgency to die down.

Interestingly, there is much doubt about the air force's effectiveness in Operation Allied Force. For example, the Air Force reported that it had destroyed 110 tanks, 210 armored vehicles, and 449 artillery pieces during the operation. However, later reports concluded that only 26 tanks, 12 armored vehicles, and 8 artillery pieces were actually hit. [4] Furthermore, a post-conflict analysis conducted by the US Army War College concluded, \"Air power neither decimated nor defeated the Yugoslav army in the field. In fact, the air strikes did very little to damage Serb forces in Kosovo.\" [5] It was actually the eventual threat of a NATO ground invasion that caused Slobodan Milosevic to yeild. <<<conclusion>>> In conclusion, there's no real evidence that air power has decisively caused victory in ANY war. Conversely, there are numerous examples of armies winning victory (or, at least, avoiding defeat) with either inferior or no air power at all. These examples include the Red Army on the eastern front, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Soviet-Afghan War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan). If air power was decisive over land forces, it would follow that the side with the best air force should always win. Yet this does not happen. To the contrary, recent history has shown that the side with the best air force often loses. Conversely, the side with the most overwhelming and most dedicated ground forces usually acheives victory.",

Surely, you don't believe that moving into space to another planet is more important than the millions of people suffering and dying from cancer, starvation and the lack of clean water.

Do you really expect humans to actually start colonizing multiple planets? When our Sun dies all the planets in our solar system will be obliterated. Unless we make it out of our entire solar system (which is virtually impossible) then we will all die eventually. We should be focussing on making everyones life a happy life and when humans finally die out - at least we would have accomplished something. Moving to another planet wont help to stop wars. It wont help to cure diseases. Even getting people to other planets will be difficult. Imagine how expensive and hard it will be to build houses and shops here so that people can live a normal life. We would be potentially designing the Earth from scratch. As well as this we would also have to be constantly importing food from the Earth. On many other planets their is no soil and plants can not grow. Many of the animals that we eat today and keep as pets will not accustom to the strange, new conditions.

Homosexual relationships are increasingly gaining acceptance in this country; however, these couples have not been permitted to marry. Some states have considered a new form of commitment called a \"civil union\", which essentially is marriage without using the word \"marriage\". Many politicians have said they are against gay marriage but think it should be left up to the states to decide. However, the \"full faith and credit\" clause of the Constitution says that if one state makes a law, other states must recognize it. Thus, if one state allows a gay marriage and that couple moves to another state, the other state must recognize that marriage. This in effect allows one state to make same-sex marriage legal in the entire country. Many politicians are calling for amendments to their state constitution or the U.S. Constitution. Many areas of the country such as San Francisco have performed marriage ceremonies in defiance of the law. Lost in all the legal battles and political maneuvering is the basic question \"Should we allow gay couples to legally marry?\" My answer is yes......",

By institutionalizing marriage we put an emphasis on the procreation aspect of nurturing the next generation, whether or not we are overpopulated (as we would still need to have children, whether or not we are overpopulated). So putting an emphasis on RESPONSIBLE procreation would still lead some benefits to society. Marriage has been this way, even in times of regional overpopulation, a institution that upholds procreation [1]. So even my opponents argument fails if we assume his position is correct, as responsible procreation would still be needed for fertility of 1-1.9. (slow decrease in population). Now I would also like to note overpopulation in modern times is a myth.

And adopting from another country (or here even) is not the same effect as responsible procreation. It is merely moving the child from point a-b. And as stated the government wants procreative type unions, not procreative effect so to speak. The states interest is in procreation, this point is a moot. My opponent then claims polygamous marriages can still obtain \"responsible\" procreation. This is false. Having a decent amount of children is not responsible, as having multiple wives still means he will likely have more children then planned. Having 3 wives, for example, and 2 kids each means you have 6 children. Now polygamous marriages will likely be more promiscuous. Having multiple wives already says things about ones character.

There is nothing necessarily wrong with a child not knowing their true parents, but when a child is missing a male or female influence, some issues will arise. Although studies show there are many children of gay couples who have no unusual issues, many of these studies are specifically made to support gay marriage. I would like to commend those who are successful without considerable fatherly or motherly influence caused by gay marriage, but still, I do not think the studies show the whole story. Part of the issue is that many children from heterosexual parents are lacking in a father of mother influence as well due to poor parenting or divorce. Most of the time, homosexuality in males is caused by a negative experience with his father [1]. This shows that a good fatherly influence is very important in a boy's life. Conversely when they are without fatherly influence at all, there are often negative results. \"Many adult sons abandoned by their fathers have difficulty developing and sustaining self-esteem, forming lasting emotional attachments, recognizing their feelings, or being expressive with their adult partners and children.\" [2] Obviously, a lack of a father or mother does not necessarily adversely affect children in all cases, showing that peoples' character is not necessarily influenced by their environment.

Sure. But without the complementary roles and the childbearing part, this is null. The fifth and sixth purposes of marriage are very similar in nature to the fourth. Protection and enjoyment. I do not doubt that homosexuals could find protection and enjoyment in one another, and I do not doubt that they do. But again without complementary roles and childbearing, this is null.

A federal judge CANNOT step in and change the will of the people. This is stated in the Federalist Papers No 45 written by James Madison: The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce[5] & [6] Since gay marriage is NOT an external object as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce, the federal government has ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT to step in and change the will of the people. If Texas wants place a ban on gay marriage, let the people of Texas decide that.",

As we read in the Book of Genesis: \"God created man in His image; in the Divine image he created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them, saying: \"Be fertile and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it.\"\" (Gen. 1:28-29) The same was taught by Our Savior Jesus Christ: \"From the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female. For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother; and shall cleave to his wife.\" (Mark 10:6-7). Also your argument that \"If you are worried about God's approval than don't get married to someone of the same sex. If someone on tv gets married and you see it you are not going to hell.\" is completely wrong. Just has the old adage says\"The righteous suffers together with the wicked.\" We see that it is also evident in the Bible which most non-religious people will not believe but that does not makes it wrong, The destruction of \"Sodom and Gomorrah\" for Homosexuality is a clear example even though not all of them were homosexuals. (Gen.19:24-25) \"The Lord rained down sulphurous fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah. He overthrew those cities and the whole Plain, together with the inhabitants of the cities and the produce of the soil.\" from the above quotation one see that a whole city or society can be destroy whether you watch it on Television or not as long as you do not try and fight against it(same-sex \"marriage\")",

            "premise": " Why is marriage regulated by the government at all? In fact, not only are there restrictions on certain types of marriages, but there are incentives for heterosexuals (not falling into the categories above) to marry. Why should the government encourage \" through tax breaks and other benefits \" some types of marriages while banning others? The rationale is that males and females, when married, are more likely to procreate, thus ensuring the continuation of American society. It is certainly to America\"s advantage to have citizens, so there exists a compelling state interest justifying government subsidization of heterosexual marriage. The banned types of marriage are similarly rationalized; offspring from family members who marry are significantly more likely to be sterile, thus unable to continue the proliferation of society, or otherwise impaired. It is therefore not in the interest of government to encourage these types of marriages. It should be obvious, by this point, which category gay marriage falls into. Same-sex couples are unable to procreate, meaning that there is no compelling interest to subsidize their marriages. At this point, many would argue that the happiness of same-sex couples would be enhanced by gay marriage, thus providing a compelling interest. This, in fact, is not the case. The government has already shown through prohibiting certain types of marriage that it does not view enhanced happiness as a compelling enough interest to encourage marriage of any kind. After all, if \"enhanced happiness\" was a compelling interest, it could be used to justify government subsidization of chocolate, which is proven to increase happiness through the release of certain endorphins. In fact, one could argue that the government should subsidize anything and everything that makes someone happy. Thus, \"enhanced happiness\" can clearly not be considered a compelling enough interest to justify the recognition and, therefore, subsidization of gay marriage.",

            "premise": " While same-sex couples certainly cannot reproduce themselves, artificial insemination for lesbians would be an option. Or it might be argued that the government should subsidize gay marriages to make it easier to adopt. Despite neither arguments of these being good enough reasons to justify legalizing any of the types of banned marriages discussed earlier, it bears discussing. Regarding families where the father is absent, research by University of Canterbury professor Bruce J. Ellis has shown that, \"greater exposure to father absence was strongly associated with elevated risk for early sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy.\" This is relevant to the debate around same-sex marriage because, in lesbian couples, any daughter would certainly be growing up apart from their biological father, thus increasing the risk of these unfortunate effects. Further evidence on the importance of having both a mother and father is provided by Stanford psychologist Eleanor MacCoby, who points out that \"mothers, on average, may have somewhat stronger parental \"instincts\" when it comes to responding to young infants.\" In male gay couples, this is by definition not the case. An increasing body of evidence shows that it is indeed more advantageous for children to grow up having both a mother and a father. Once again, we cannot put the \"enhanced happiness\" that same-sex couples would get from raising a child above the well-being of that child. <<<conclusion>>> Gay marriage is not a civil rights issue; it is a question of whether or not there exists a compelling enough interest for the government to subsidize and encourage gay marriage. As same-sex couples cannot procreate and, in fact, have the potential to harm any children they might raise, it is certainly in the interest of the federal government to maintain the stance it presented in the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Section 2 states \"the word \"marriage\" means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word \"spouse\" refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.\"",

This contradicts con when he says, \"[Is abortion] unlawful? Well, abortion is legal. Which is to say that abortion is permitted by law. So, no, abortion is not unlawful.\" When con said, \"Abortion is legal,\" without distinguishing that abortion is illegal in certain areas, we can assume that he intended to say, \"Abortion is universally legal,\" meaning that abortion is not illegal in any part of the world. However, as I have just stated, several countries have banned abortion under all circumstances. Since a large part of con's argument is based upon the fact that abortion is legal and can therefore cannot be classified as murder, and since it has been established that abortion is indeed illegal in several countries, we must move on to the next point.",

He has stated that an acorn is not an oak tree, but is an oak tree in development. I will respond to this analogy with an analogy of my own. Imagine that there is a cake baking in the oven. Now, we refer to the confection baking in the oven as a cake, even though the confection is still in the process of being developed in the oven by means of heat. Now imagine that the oven is a metaphor for the womb, and the cake is a metaphor for a fetus. Would that change the fact that a fetus is a human? I will also remind you of how Abraham Lincoln pointed out that if we were to regard a sheep's tail as a leg, the sheep would still have only four legs. This means that if we were to call an object something that it isn't, we do not change what it is. If we were to consider a fetus something other than a human, we do not change the fact that it is a human.",

This information is furthered by the Guttmacher institute in 1998, which after conducting a study on 1,773 women, found that 2.3% of them did so because of potential danger to lives. Examples of a condition that necessitates abortion could include Ectopic pregnancies, where a fetus develops outside of the uterus where it is supposed to (3). The amount of these pregnancies has increased even with medical technology becoming incredibly refined in recent years. In Northern Europe and the US there was increased prevalence, with Ectopic pregnancies being roughly 5 times as prevalent in 2000 than 1970 according to the NCBI in August of 2000 (4). Ectopic pregnancies are classified by the National Institute of Health as life threatening and an instance in which the fetus will not live either (5).  The sort of uneasiness in providing abortions has put a significant burden on health care providers who provide the service. One Wisconsin provider told Rewire Magazine in 2012 that physicians typically struggle in allowing for abortions when it threatens the mother\u2019s life. \u201cShould an abortion be considered when there is only a 20% risk of death to the mother?\u201d The provider asks (6). If there is a risk to a mother\u2019s life, not only should she ought to know, but the idea that physicians face significant moral boundaries to performing an abortion shows that even if a woman is likely to die, there might still be problems in allowing abortions. If a woman has the right to an abortion, this problem is averted as she could undergo the medical procedure by consenting to the operation. Since this is taken away by my opponent, the violation of the mother\u2019s rights is at risk.",

Within the ideology of libertarianism, there is great controversy on the subject of abortions because it all depends on whether the fetus is alive or not. If the fetus is alive then libertarians are against abortions because libertarians are individualists and therefore value the life of the individual heavily [1]. If the fetus is not alive then libertarians advocate abortion because libertarians belief in a less powerful and restrictive government. In our first contention we will prove the fetus to be living. For now we will explain why we should have an abortion under libertarian belief. Capitalism magazine explains this well by saying, \u201c    A fetus does not have a right to be in the womb of any woman, but is there by her permission. This permission may be revoked by the woman at any time, because her womb is part of her body... There is no such thing as the right to live inside the body of another, i.e., there is no right to enslave... a woman is not a breeding pig owned by the state (or church).\u201d     [2] She is the individual that libertarians prioritize, due to their individualist ideologies [2].

            "premise": " The Fetus Is Not Alive Firstly, it is important to note that only 1.4% of abortions occur after 21 weeks into the pregnancy [3,4]. This means that that most abortions are done before the fetus is even formed. It is just an embryo, and an embryo is proven to be not alive, it is not a debate like with the fetus. It is a fact when referring to the embryo that it is not alive [5]. Now that this is covered, I will address the issue of the fetus - which is already mitigated due to the minute percentage of abortions that occur at this period into the pregnancy. There are 7 categories in which life can be identified and this is often put into the acronym: MRS GREN to make it easier to remember [6]. The fetus only meets two of these. Movement - The fetus can move so this part is met. Respiration - The fetus cannot respire on its own (7). Sensitivity - The fetus cannot sense at 24 weeks or even 28 weeks (8). Growth - The fetus does grow. Reproduction - Whilst it is a fetus, no it cannot reproduce (9). Excretion - This is possible however very rare and unlikely (10). Nutrition - The fetus cannot independently take in nutrition. If one of these wasn\u2019t met then the fetus would not be considered alive. The fetus was only able to meet 2 of these. Making it considered not alive scientifically (6).",

            "premise": " Illegal Abortions When an abortion is legal there is absolutely no point in having an illegal abortion because they have been proven to be very dangerous and expensive. If abortion are legal then illegal abortions will negatively correlate (11). These illegal abortions have been known to kill both the mother and the baby and sometimes result in extreme suffering on the mother\u2019s part (11). Mothers are not doctors (most of the time) so these illegal abortions also occur later than 24 (and even 28) weeks meaning that the babies suffer too (11)! Did you know that: \u201c13% of pregnancy-related deaths worldwide are related to complications of unsafe abortion.\u201d(12) This statistic is shocking but demonstrates my point very well. These unsafe abortions are illegal abortions and this is what is currently happening because abortions are illegal in places. They have no option to a safe abortion and are so desperate for abortion that they attempt to undergo illegal and unsafe abortions. Therefore, we can conclude that there are a huge number of unsafe abortions (13% of all pregnancy related deaths). From this we can then follow up an argument suggesting that making abortions illegal will not necessarily get rid of all abortions therefore rendering our opponent\u2019s aim to be mitigated.",

            "premise": " Underage teenagers \u201c19% of teens who have had sexual intercourse become pregnant each year. 78% of these pregnancies are unplanned. 6 in 10 teen pregnancies occur among 18-19 year olds.\u201d (12) This statistic is significant for many reasons. If this occurs amongst 18 - 19 year olds then this is extremely bad. Having to look after and care for a child ruins their chances of going to university. Your twenties are your most important period of your lives according to many sources (13,14,15). Having to look after a child in this period of time is extremely stressful and prevents you from getting proper qualifications and more importantly, it prevents you from getting a full time job and a house. Children are extremely expensive to have and having a child at the time when you should be looking for a job makes income problematic. On top of this you will have to pay huge amounts of money. \u201cTo raise a child born in 2013 to the age of 18, it will cost a middle-income couple just over $245,000, according to newly released estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's up $4,260, or almost 2%, from the year before.\u201d(16) Now let's compare this to the average income of a family: \u201cThe typical U.S. households pulls in $51,371 per year.\u201d Teenage parents are most likely to make a lot less than this but let's take this statistic anyway. Assuming that this \u2018average\u2019 family spend no money at all on anything. It will still cost them almost 5 times their yearly income to equate to that amount. Of course they will need food, clothes, mortgage, heating, electricity etc. on top of this sum of money. If this seems like a lot you should double the cost of a child figures (assuming that they have another child), what will you do then? Not allow an abortion? Allow these teenagers to pay almost $500,000, earning (most likely) less than $51,371 per year.",

            "premise": " Gender Equality Pregnancies have a huge impact upon people\u2019s lives - in particular the mother. As Sarah Weddington stated: \u201cA pregnancy to a woman is perhaps one of the most determinative aspects of her life. It disrupts her body. It disrupts her education. It disrupts her employment. And it often disrupts her entire family life.\u201d (17) She continued: \u201c[And we feel that], because of the impact on the woman, this \u2026 is a matter which is of such fundamental and basic concern to the woman involved that she should be allowed to make the choice as to whether to continue or to terminate her pregnancy.\u201d (17) This was a very important case showing that without the right to a termination, you are denying women a right and therefore what my opponent is advocating is gender inequality. The philosopher, Judith Thomson said: \u201cIf abortion rights are denied, then a constraint is imposed on women's freedom to act in a way that is of great importance to them, both for its own sake and for the sake of their achievement of equality .... and if the constraint is imposed on the ground that the foetus has a right to life from the moment of conception, then it is imposed on a ground that neither reason nor the rest of morality requires women to accept, or even to give any weight at all.\u201d (17) This emphasizes my previous point in regards to the denial of gender rights and equality and therefore we come to the following conclusion: P1: Denying women an abortion is gender inequality P2: Gender inequality is a violation of human rights C1: Abortion legalization stops gender inequality rights C2: Abortions should be legalized",

The correlation is evident between the lack of abortion and the maternal mortality. By the end of 2015, 303,000 mothers would have died due to the lack of abortion availability (18).",

            "premise": " Personhood With these terms clarified, we can now discuss what ought to be considered a person. There are many thresholds which people have come up with to determine when personhood begins, but it is still very much in debate today. You believe abortions should be illegal \"unless the mother is a condition in which she can't handle the pregnancy.\" I can infer from this that you believe the point of conception, or the fusion of gametes to initiate the development of a human, is the beginning of human personhood, and therefore entitled to the right of life. Also, the only justification in aborting the newly-formed zygote is if a person of equal value, the mother, would be at risk of death from attempting to give birth to the would-be baby. So, why not choose fertilization as the starting point? My argument for brain activity as the beginning of personhood is founded on that idea that our minds are what make us ourselves. Our individuality, consciousness, characteristics, and livelihood are not just simply attached to the genetic and cellular foundations from fertilization. We require more than that. An active brain is needed for us completely fulfill these ideas of being a person. Not only does brain activity make a good indicator for when we are living people, but it is consistent with our definition of when we are dead. As I explained earlier, our definition of death is dependent on when brain activity ceases. If this is when we consider someone dead, why not be the determiner of when someone is alive? The most reasonable thing to do is to have a consistent set of ethics and make brain activity the beginning of personhood. <<<conclusion>>> Conclusion For all the ideas of when personhood should begin, brain activity would be the most reasonable. To quote a doctor named John Goldenring, \"By accepting a functioning brain as a medical definition for humanness, one can achieve a very reasonable, scientifically grounded and consistent view of human life. Such a definition allows us to look at all of life from the development of a single cell to the death of the last cell in a body in the same way. We need not encounter any logical dilemmas if we apply a brain-life test and we can use it as an instrument to aid policy and ethical decisions.\"(4)",

            "premise": " Contention 1: convicting a cyberbully would be extremely difficult According to law professor Susan Brenner and juris doctor Megan Rehberg, to get a conviction against a defendant for bombarding someone with emotionally distressing messages, one needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to cause the inflicted harm. This is very difficult, especially if only one harmful message was sent. How does one know what another's intentions are? How does one prove to others what they are? In the case of harassment, the act of harassing or annoying someone, the Supreme Court has ruled that the term annoy is too vague, as something that annoys one will not annoy another. Getting around this ruling would be an astronomical challenge. Convicting (and making a law against cyberbullying) is made even more difficult by the First Amendment, which states that \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\"",

            "premise": " Contention 2: the damage from bullying cannot be reduced by criminalizing it Bullying is an act that commonly occurs in schools of all regions and income levels. Cyberbullying is no different. Is cyberbullying any less damaging to the individual and to society than traditional bullying? Should we turn a blind eye on traditional bullying and vainly assert our authority over cyberspace? Is traditional bullying even possible to prevent? Apparently not, since it has and continues to occur in our best schools. Cyberbullying is also impossible to prevent. According to jezebel.com, \"45 states now have some sort of anti-cyberbullying law, but harassment researcher Catherine Hill says there's no indication yet that they actually prevent bullying.\" If it's not possible to prevent any type of bullying, what use is it to turn the government's attention towards cyberbullying? How many lives can we truly save when we cannot prevent victims from being abused? The answer to cyberbullying is not law enforcement, but social education. According to Newsday, \"Statistics from the state Department of Education show a nearly 11 percent decline on the Island in incidents reported as intimidation or bullying from 2006-2007 to 2008-2009. Long Island schools offer many types of anti-bullying programs.\" People need to be educated on how to deal with abusive and relentless people. People need to know what to do when they are abused or when someone they know is abused. People need to know that suicide is not the answer and that there are better solutions to their problems. The government would get much greater returns investing their money in social education rather than new prisons for cyberbullies.",

            "premise": " Contention 3: current laws are adequate when dealing with cyberbullying According to the Congressional Research Service, limitations on the freedom of speech and press are obscenities (profanity), child pornography, true threats, inciting panic when there's no danger, and defamation (slander and libel). The types of cyberbullying are spreading rumors, targeting, identity theft, sharing embarrassing photos and e-mails, excluding, and harassment (according to the Media Awareness Network). Spreading rumors is defamation and is illegal. Identity theft is illegal. Sharing photos of a minor without their parents' permission is illegal. Harassment based on any trait that cyberbullies could think of to attack is illegal. That means that most forms of cyberbullying are illegal. The forms that aren't illegal are forms of traditional bullying that are commonplace in schools. These should be dealt with by counselors, and not law officials. <<<conclusion>>> Therefore, it is evident that cyberbullying should not be a criminal offense. Convicting cyberbullies would be difficult, damage from bullying would not be reduced, and the new law would be over-controlling since current laws already solve the problem.",

And this Lord God creates the peoples.\" (Hitler) Max Domarus & Patrick Romane. The Essential Hitler: Speeches and Commentary. Bolchazy-Carducci. (2007). P. 499. \"We were convinced that the people need and require this faith. We have therefore undertaken the fight against the atheistic movement, and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations; we have stamped it out\" (Hitler) Speech in Berlin. October 24, 1933 This next quote is most damning against your argument. \"My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God\"s truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice\"For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.\" (Hitler) Norman H. Baynes. The Speeches of Adolf Hitler. Vol.1. Oxford University Press (1942). pp. 19-20. The list goes on however there are more than speeches that show that Hitler was a theist. Such as the fact that his soldiers all wore the slogan, \"Gott Mit Uns\" (God with us) on their belts, that his birthday was \"celebrated from the pulpits until his death,\" as Hitchens so eloquently put it, and another most erie point is that the Nazis published their own slightly revised Christian bible. Susannah Heschel. The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany. Princeton University Press. (2008) Chapter 3: Projects of the Institute. https://michaelsherlockauthor.wordpress.com... In conclusion... I believe it is obvious that Hitler was indeed a theist, and although his thoughts on christianity may have been twisted indeed, does not play a role in this debate. Thus from the facts I have presented Hitler was a theist. I look forward to my opponents response.",

It says \"  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\"   which means Congress is prohibited from establishing any form of national religion under constitutional law. It also states that   \"...or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\"   which means, like every other U.S. citizen, elected officials are allowed to PRACTICE the religion of their choice and  this is protected  but they CANNOT use their political power to pass laws regarding their religious beliefs. This would be in direct violation of the First Amendment because using one particular religion to pass laws would be classified as a  government action that unduly favors one religion over another.  The First Amendment  also prohibits the government from  unduly preferring religion over non-religion, or non-religion over religion.",

            "premise": " \"Therefore, so long as representatives are voting and debating (just a vote and some argumentation that doesn't infringe on anyone) instead of creating a theocracy, they're perfectly justified in exercising their religion.\" Actually they cannot. When debating the passing of new laws congress must take into consideration the reasoning behind their stance behind the law. They must also express their stance to the courts who will then decide whether of not their stance is a valid one. If the only reasoning they have in support or opposition of law is their religion, they are automatically in violation of First Amendment law, the same law they took an oath to abide by. \"The point of a representative government is to represent the people.\" While this is true, it is only true to a certain extent. Elected officials have an obligation to represent the people, however they can only represent the people so long as they abide by constitutional law, if they do not, their representation is overruled. \"If the representatives don't represent, then they were elected in vain creating an oppressive government who allows people to elect people who want to vote the same way as them, but they're not allowed to because people that don't like religion said so.\" Actually this is not correct. Establishing laws that ALL citizens are required to follow based on ONE particular set of religious beliefs is oppression. The majority cannot use power in numbers to overrule the rights and freedoms of people they disagree with if it does not infringe their own rights. It doesn't really matter who they voted for or why, the law is still very clear on the subject and specifically states that  the United States Constitution forbids the government from establishing an official religion, but also prohibits government actions that unduly favor one religion over another. It also prohibits the government from unduly preferring religion over non-religion, or non-religion over religion.  When it comes to the law, the citizens cannot abuse the power of elected officials to overrule the constitutional rights of other people. It can only be done under very specific circumstances and even then it still cannot interfere with the lives of other people. \"No law has created an official religion for the nation. People may use it as part of their personal belief system when voting, but no religion has been established.\" If the government allows the establishment of religious based laws, that would no longer be considered a  secular  government. It doesn't matter if the religion was made national or not, if religion is used to pass a law, that is using theocratic ideologies.",

That does not work in the courts, which is why many of them have been denied. With the legalization of gay marriage in one state alone, many officials have attempted to pass bills that would prevent same sex couples from marriage, and they have all been struck down immediately because they were in direct violation of Constitutional law.",

I don't think that is by any means a small number, come on knight, it's more than half of the accusations. I agree that a real rape is a brutal crime against both men and women(out of every 10 rape victims, 1 is a male), and I am not denying that it requires the harshest of punishments. But what about this 53% figure. Shouldn't these men be given justice equally. Shouldn't these women be equally prosecuted and punished severely, but sadly this is not happening.

Customers, however, have an inverse relationsship between purchases and price; higher prices will mean  less  purchasing. There exists a concept known as equilibrium, where consumers and suppliers \"meet in the middle\" and determine a price for any given good. However, when supply   increases   price must decrease, all else equal. If the equilibrium price of a good is $5, and the equilibrium quantity is 100, that will result in  REVENUE  of $500. However, if this good costs $3 to make, the company shall only recieve $200 in profit. For this same good, if supply is increase such that the equilibrium quantity is 200, and the equilibrium price is $2, the company shall  lose  $100, as the cost of the good to the  company  does not change unless the company makes adjustments. I say this to say that, given the nature of the FMC system that i have espoused here, consumption that continues to increase shall lead to  less  profit, not more. Given the property rights system, mixed with the cap-and-trade system, continuous consumption will begin to cost more than the good that is produce makes for the company. The  ONLY  option the company has is to cut costs, which means they must go back and re-assess their output of pollution, and consumption of resources. On this point, PRO fails to affirm the resolution, as has been the case throughout this debate. This is just one example.",

I have explained the policies that would be in place within a FMC economy, and shown how they promote eco-friendly business operations.

            "premise": " As i mentioned above, profit, and supply and demand, are key drivers of FMC economies. To increase price, supply must be limited, or, alternatively, customers must be willing to pay a higher price. Either of these is possible. However,  profit  is not determined by supply and demand alone. Costs are also involved, and if the costs of consumption of any given resource becomes higher than the revenue from the good(s) produced from that resoource, consumption will inevitably stop. Otherwise, the company would be losing money, have no way to sustain  itself , and thus have to shut down. This is true of any business, as well as individuals. When expenses are higher than revenue (also considered income), something must change, either income must rise, or expenses must decline. I have explained to you how increases in consumption will not necessarily lead to increases in profit, and how the likely result of consumption, given the high probability of production, is actually a  decrease  in revenue. This is a natural limiting factor, which pre-exists within capitalist economic structuring. In PRO's round THREE response, he states \"[Forcing companies to internalize costs] may reduce the damaged caused, but how would it give back?...and feel entitled to do whatever you want with it.\"",

I am not sure how anyone in any sytem would be able to replenish oil, but i believe i understand the point PRO is attempting to make. If foresters were to own any given area of a forest, what incentive would they have to limit their consumption, and replenish the resources present? Since business owners have capital already invested within the forest, they then have every incentive to \"milk the land for all it is worth\". Similar to gardeners, who will plant, harvest, and re-plant, in all likelihood, business owners would utilize a given section of the land area they own, harvest the tree, re-plant, and give the land time to regrow, while moving on to a different section. This is only one example. For polluting industries, per the continuous cap-and-trade system, they will have to purchase more and more caps for all the additional units of pollution they produce, plus the past units of pollution. If Profit is a key driver, and this is a highly variable, ever-increasing cost, companies will have the incentive to find a way to lower the cost.

Per characteristic 3, Government has the \"right\" to regulate, but  not  the right to intervene. This means that government, more specifically the EPA, can act as a police force in order to ensure industry is indeed taking responsibility for it's actions. This is no different from having policemen, and detectives, active to prevent murderers, theives, and rapists from avoiding punishment. In each case, the actor (person who does) is held responsible for their actions (the something they did). This does not violate any of the principles i have stated, nor the characteristics i stated. PRO's arguments seem to be based on presuppositions that neither I, nor the audience, have been made aware of. PRO does not offer support, evidence, or justification for any of the assertions that have been made. As such, PRO fails to uphold his Burden of Proof, as well as affirm the resolution. <<<conclusion>>> I have presented (what i subjectively consider) rational arguments for the environmental soundness and sustainability of a Free-Market Capitalist economy, as i explained it in Round 1.

            "premise": " Minority vote per state bears no weight            In the Electoral College (EC), every state votes one way or the other, meaning that the presidential vote for that state is determined by over 50% of the voters voting for that candidate. This makes it so that if 51% of the voters in a certain state vote for one candidate while the other 49% of voters vote for the other candidate, then the 51% is what determines the outcome of that state\u2019s decision. Immediately we see a flaw in this system, the 49% of the votes don\u2019t count as a vote towards the president at all. That minority vote has no effect whatsoever on the outcome of the election.      As we examine the politics of each state, we notice that each state votes differently based on how urban and how rural the state is. States with more urban populations tend to vote Democrat, while rural states trend Republican. Let\u2019s take Illinois for example. Illinois virtually always votes Democrat because of the urban population of Chicago. Since most of the people in that state live in Chicago, the state is solid blue and Republican voters in the rural part of the state are always swept over by the overwhelming vote in Chicago. This is the cause of why many people do not vote at all, because they know their votes will have no effect since a very urban city such as Chicago is also representing their state. Even some Democratic voters know that participating in the election is pointless seeing as how their state is already solid blue. If we abolish the electoral college, more people will vote in the presidential elections.      Swing states are the ones who really determine each election. In the last several elections, the only states whose votes make a difference are Virginia, Florida, and Ohio. The major flaw of the electoral college is that if you want your vote to count the most, you need to move to a swing state. If you remain in a solid state, your vote will have a much lesser effect if any on the next president.",

As of the 2004 election, Colorado had nine times the population as Wyoming, but only three times the electoral votes[1]. The weight of a vote in Wyoming is more than the weight of a vote in Colorado. The Constitution guarantees ever    state, no matter how small, at least three votes in the EC. Small states wield a disproportionate share of clout when choosing a president. This may be a little too generous for smaller states. Some people argue that the EC keeps larger states from getting too powerful in elections. However, a popular vote would make sure that no state, large or small, would ever get too powerful. It would be a perfect system in this regard, unlike the EC. A vote in Wyoming would be equal to a vote in California. Such it is that the number of electoral votes is inaccurate to the population of each state. Yet, the EC has done this so that a minority President can be elected.",

Although Al Gore won 560,000 more votes than Bush[2], Bush grabbed 30 states while Gore took the remaining 20 plus the District of Columbia. This clearly shows that the EC is an inaccurate representation of democracy and won\u2019t always elect the candidate with the popular request to take office.      In fact, it is possible to win the presidency with 21.91% of the population voting for you and 78.09% voting against you[3]. This is possible because the EC grants small states more electoral votes in proportion to the population of those small states in relation to big states.",

            "premise": " Third party candidates get nothing          Third party candidates are hardly ever represented in the EC. In fact, some third party votes usually tweak the voting outcome of a state, pushing both the Republican and Democrat candidates below 50% so that a Libertarian or Green candidate can get 2 or 3% of the vote. In some state elections, the outcome has been 49% - 49% - 2%. Since none of the candidates received majority vote, a runoff election is triggered making it so that in a future election only two candidates are on the ballot, while the third party runner is discarded and does not receive a single electoral vote. If a direct popular vote replaces the EC, a third party candidate will receive more of the vote, maybe 100,000 votes nationwide and 1% of the nation\u2019s vote. This is much more fair to that candidate because at least he or she was considered in the results of the national election. <<<conclusion>>> In short, there is not one mob rule in this system, but      fifty     mob rules. A winner-takes-all system based on the region of space you are living in is unfair to the people living both in that space and outside of it. The whole nation will benefit from abolishing the Electoral College and all of the problems that once existed with it will be gone.",

However there is no evidence, no proof, that this is so. In fact, none of the given scenarios require beliefs at all. These scenarios derive solely from a cause -> effect, and ignore belief. A)Take for example the military strategy in Iraq, the U.S. Government reforms the plan, evolves it, if you will, based on the current situation in Iraq. This requires no belief, it's based solely around cause -> effect. I'm sure many of us here have taken Algebra, look at this as a metaphor. The cause of the evolvement of the military strategy is the independant variable, and the evolvement of the strategy is the dependant variable. Beliefs would be another variable altogether, upsetting the algorithm. B)Also, look at the finch scenario. The finches had different beaks, due to their surroundings differing. This clearly demonstrates the cause -> effect idea, because it doesn't require any belief, any system of ideas on the creation of the universe to occur. How can you possibly argue that a system that requires no beliefs or ideals to occur can possibly be a belief system? That's completely contradictory to the definition of belief!",

Evolution does not refer to the idea of evolution. That's not evolution, that's the Evolutionary Theory or the theory of Natural Selection. These are things that we are not debating today, we are debating evolution. As you can clearly see, the evolution that we are discussing here is the physical act of evolution. This physical act is not a belief, because it's demonstrated physically as a cause to effect. www.dictionary.com also defines evolution as \"a motion incomplete in itself, but combining with coordinated motions to produce a single action, as in a machine. \" this only reaffirms the cause->effect instance. Evolution is the regulated effect that occurs when something sparks, machinelike. As any logic thinking being will agree, a machine is not a belief. I do not believe in my toaster. However, when I put bread in, it comes out toasted. This requires no belief, this action is not a belief, and evolution is not a belief.",
